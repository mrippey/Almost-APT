# Almost-APT 

After watching the tutorial by [maksimKorzh](https://github.com/maksimKorzh/code-monkey-search), I was intrigued to find out
what I could also do with some Flask and MongoDB. 

Almost-APT focuses on cyber threat actors who have not quite yet been designated as APT's (Advanced Persistent Threats). This 
simple application allows users to search for information on different threat actor groups, with additional details like 
malware utilized, sectors targeted, and countries targeted. 

## :clipboard: TODO:
* Continue updating the application with Javascript to make the environment more interactive for the user.
* Edit the text search parameters in MongoDB to have a user search by malware used.
* Keep learning web development!!

## :nut_and_bolt: Usage:
* This app is currently under development, and will not be ready for production for some time. Check back here occasionally!
