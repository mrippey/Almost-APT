# Almost-APT 

After watching the tutorial by [maksimKorzh](https://github.com/maksimKorzh/code-monkey-search), I was intrigued to find out
what I could also do with some Flask and MongoDB. 

Almost-APT provides users with a searchable database of cyber threat actors who have not quite yet been designated as APT's (Advanced Persistent Threats).
As additional functionality is added, I hope this app will allow researchers or anyone interested to get a quick grasp of threat
groups who may not be well known.

Information currently available to users: 
* Countries targeted
* Sectors targeted 
* Malware used 

## :clipboard: TODO:
* Get rid of the Python List output in the information displayed to the user.
* Add functionality to Home and Links.
* Add/remove rows on output page to what is most likely interesting to the user.
* Allow users to query by malware used, in addition to group name.
* Add some Javascript (still learning) to provide a more interactive experience.

## :nut_and_bolt: Usage:
* This app is currently under development, and will not be ready for production for some time. Check back here occasionally!
